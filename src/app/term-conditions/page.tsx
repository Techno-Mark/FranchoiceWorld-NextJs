                members or others. If any part of this contract is determined to
                be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to any applicable law
                including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and
                liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or
                unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
                unenforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of
                the original provision and the remainder of the contract (as and
                when amended) shall continue in effect. Unless otherwise
                specified herein, this contract constitutes the entire agreement
                between the user and the Company with respect to the Site and
                its related services and it supersedes all prior or
                contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether
                electronic, oral or written, between the user and Company with
                respect to the use of the Site and its services.
